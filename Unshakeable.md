# Section 1 - Wealth: The Rule Book

### Chapter 1: Unshakeable

None of us likes putting effort into things that make us feel unseccessful and out of out dept! When people are forced to make financial decisions, they often act out of fear - and any decision made in a state of fear is likely to be wrong.

**You can't win this game unless you have the emotional fortitude to get in it and stay in it for the long term**

### Chapter 2: Winter is coming... But when?

**Fact 1: On average, corrections have occurred about once a year since 1900**

The average correction has lasted only 54 days. In the average correction over the last 100 years, the market has fallen only 13,5%.

**Fact 2: Less than 20% of all corrections turn into a bear market**

When the market starts tumbling - especially when it's down more than 10% - many people hit their pain threshold and start to sell because they're scared that this drop could turn into a dead spiral.

**Fact 3: Nobody can predict consistently whether the market will rise or fall**

**Fact 4: The stock market rises over time despite many short-term setbacks**

**Fact 5: Bear markets have happened every three to five years**

Bear markets don't last.

**Fact 6: Bear markets become bull markets, and pessimism becomes optimism**

**Fact 7: The greatest danger is being out of the market**

You have to be in the game. To put it another way, fear isn't rewarded. Courage is.

If you stay in the market long enough, compounding works its magic, and you end up with a healthy return - even if your timing was hopelessly unlucky. 

When it comes to your finances, ignorance is pain and poverty.

### Chapter 7: Slay the bear

If you want to be certain that you'll never lose money in the financial markets, you can keep your savings in cash - but then you'll never stand a chance of achieving financial freedom. 

Bear markets are the ultimate gift for opportunistic investors with a long-term perspective.

# Section 3 - The Psychology of wealth

If you fail to master your own psychology, you may ultimately become the victim of a costly form of financial self-sabotage.

**Recency bias:** recent experiences carry more weight in our minds when we're evaluating the odds of something happening in the future.

The biggest mistake that the small investor makes is to buy when the market is going up on the assumption that the market will go up further - and sell when the market is going down on the assumption thatit's going to go down further.

**Mistake 3: Overconfidence** - Admitting to yourself that you have no special advantage, you give yourself an enormous advantage! You'll do so much better than all those overconfident investors who delude themselves into believing they can outperform. When it comes to investing, self-deception may be the biggest expense of all!

**Mistake 4: Greed and gambling** - When we/re winning, our bodies release chemicals called endorphins, so we feel euphoiric and don't want to stop; when we're losing, we don't want to stop either, since we crave those endorphins and also want to avoid the emotional pain of losses.

The best way to win the game of investing is to achive sustainable long-term returns.

Wall street wins by getting you to be more active, but you win by patiently staying in the game for decades.

### Chapter 9 - Real Wealth

LIFE IS JUST TOO SHORT TO SUFFER.

If you make the decision to master your own mind, you'll be mentally equipped to handle whatever challenges come your way.
