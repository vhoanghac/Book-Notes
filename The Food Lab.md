## Introduction: 

### What's in this book?
**Cooking has always been considered a craft, not a science. Restaurant cooks act as apprentices, learning, but not questioning, their chefs’techniques. Home cooks follow the notes and recipes of their mothers and grandmothers or cookbooks—perhaps tweaking them here and there to suit modern tastes, but never challenging the fundamentals.**

### The keys to good kitchen science
The scientific method is based on making observations, keeping track of those observations, coming up with hypotheses to explain those observations, and then performing tests designed to disprove those hypotheses.

### What is Cooking?

**Dense** The denser a medium, the more energy it will contain at a given temperature. As a rule, metals are denser than liquids, which, in turn, are denser than air. So metals at, say, 60°F will contain more energy than liquids at 60°F, which will contain more energy than air at 60°F.

### Esential kitchen gear

My pot was too thin and its conductivity was too low. Rather than distributing the heat evenly over the bottom of the entire pot, the heat was concentrated in the areas directly above the flames. Those areas got overheated, causing the proteins in the cream
directly above them to coagulate, stick to each other (and to the pot), and eventually burn. Without the emulsifying effect of the proteins, the fat in thecream separated out into a distinct, greasy yellow layer.

#### Pot and pan

Stainless steel is very easy to maintain but it also is an extremely poor heat conductor.

How do you gauge the heat distribution performance of a pan? The easiest way is to spread a thin layer of sugar evenly over the bottom, then heat it over a burner. The pattern in which the sugar melts will indicate the pan’s hot and cold spots.

**Cast-iron**: 
- My cast-iron pans give me golden brown fried chicken, sizzling bacon, corn bread, apple pies, well-charred hash, perfectly seared steaks, bubbly pizzas, and crisp dumplings. 
- The pan doesn’t cool down when you add food to it. The edges of the pan will never get hot. To heat a cast-iron pan effectively, you need a burner equal in size to the pan.
- You can’t cook overly acidic foods in it: Acidic foods will pick up flavor and color from the iron, turning them dingy and metallic-tasting. This means that until a very good layer of seasoning has developed, even quick wine-based pan sauces are out of the question, as are acidic recipes like tomato sauce.

**Steek Wok**:
- Stainless steel woks are a waste of money.
- Your best bet is a wok with a 4- to 5-inch-wide flattened area at the bottom.
- Avoid nonstick woks like the plague. Most nonstick coatings cannot handle the high heat necessary for a proper stir-fry.

#### Cooking oil

The enemies of oil are heat and light, which means that the way most people store them—in clear bottles close to the stove—is just about the worst thing you can do.

1. Oil, canola (for sautéing) - Dầu hạt cải
2. Oil, extra-virgin olive (for flavoring)
3. Oil, peanut (for deep-frying)
