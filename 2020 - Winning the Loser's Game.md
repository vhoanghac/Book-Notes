# Winning the Loser's Game

## Introduction:
The crux of the problem is that mutual fund managers generally fail to discharge their fiduciary responsibility to investors. Instead of putting investor interests front and center, which would require limiting assets under management to levels that might allow active management success, mutual fund managers succumb to the siren song of bloated funds that generate bloated profits.

Why is the size the enemy of performance? Larger size requires more positions. Instead of a manager’s twenty best ideas, a larger fund contains the manager’s fifty (or one hundred) best ideas. What is the chance that the fiftieth (or one hundredth!) best idea is a good as the twentieth? Not very high. As the size of assets under management increases, the size of the investable universe decreases. Large funds compete to win by investing in large companies that are heavily researched and efficiently priced. Smaller nimble funds have a distinct advantage in the performance derby, choosing among less heavily researched and less efficiently priced securities.

At the same time as excessive assets impede performance, they generate handsome profits for the managers. As size increases, fees increase. Expenses fail to keep pace, turning the actively managed mutual fund into a profit machine. 

Mutual fund managers further breach their fiduciary responsibility with extraordinarily high rates of portfolio turnover, estimated by Ellis to be in the neighborhood of 60% to 80% per year. High turnover, resulting from a futile attempt to beat the market on a short-term basis, leads to realization of gains (in our generally rising markets), which results in a tax bill for the investor. A true fiduciary would operate with a longer investment horizon or close high-turnover funds to taxable investors.

Ellis correctly notes that investors frequently fail to maintain equity exposure in times of market stress. He believes the solution is education and fortitude. I believe the solution is broad diversification (and education and fortitude).

Faced with information that contradicts what they believe, people tend to respond in one of two ways. Some ignore the new knowledge and hold firmly to their beliefs. Others accept the validity of the new information, factor it into their perception of reality, and put it to use. Most investment managers and most individual investors, being in a sustained state of denial, are holding on to a set of romantic beliefs developed in a long-gone era of different markets. Their romantic views of “investment opportunity” are repeatedly—and increasingly—proving to be false.

## Chapter 2: THE WINNER'S GAME

For all its amazing complexity, the field of investment management really has only two major parts. One is the profession: doing what is best for the returns for investment clients, and the other is the business: doing what is best for the profits of investment managers. Investment firms must be successful at both to retain the trust of clients and to maintain a viable business—and in the long run, the latter depends on the former. 

Investment management differs from many other professions in one most unfortunate way: it is losing the struggle to put professional values and responsibilities first and business objectives second. 

The sad truth is that time and again investors, both institutional and individual, buy after the best results and sell out after the worst is over. This behavior is costly to investors.8
