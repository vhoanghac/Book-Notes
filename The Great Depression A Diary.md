# The Great Depression A Diary

### Introduction by James Ledbetter

Yet the more I read the diary, the more I realized that no one living in the 1930s had known for certain that they were headed into a depression, either, until they were in its midst.

October 24, mass selling caused the prices of the stocks to drop dramatically, as brokers couldn't find buyers to keep the stock value afloat. Investors' panic continued on Monday, October 28. Then on Tuesday, October 29, the market completely collapsed: More than sixteen million shares traded and fifteen billion dollars in assets were lost.

While the Great Crash didn't cause instant mass unemployment or suddenly halt production lines, the events of October 1929 did expose structural problems in the 1920s boom economy. As families, earning on average just $2000 a year, cut back on their spending, manufacturers, stuck with overstock and expensive overhead, began to lay off workers. As the unemployed struggled with bills and consumed even less, more companies cut back on workers or even closed up shop.

As Roth watches the market mostly plunge in the 1931-1932 period, he seems mostly to feel that **stocks are a sucker's game**. At the same time, he is tantalized by the prospect of bargain hunting among stocks -notably railroads and steel- that had lost nearly all their value, even though their underlying businesses seemed sure to rebound eventually. He also began to see that **even though real estate seemed like a reliable investment, in a prolonged downturn, it could be devastating.** The cost of upkeep, taxes, mortgage payments, and insurance are usually inflexible, whereas rental income could easily dry up if renters don't have jobs. **He later regretted not having had the available cash to buy stocks when they hit historic lows and then recovered**. (only in very large companies)

### Volume 1 - June, 5 1931 - October 17, 1931

##### June 5, 1931

1929: The return of thousands of soldiers to civil life had brought a boom to real estate, clothing and other retail trades.

In 1924, real estate and building transactions became fewer and fewer, an experienced economist might have recognized all these signs but to most of us, it meant nothing.

The average man who wanted to invest or speculate used real estate as a medium and it was still considered a truism that the most sure way to build a fortune was through the ownership of real estate.

In 1929 when the crash came all sorts of people were into the market on margins over their heads-doctors, layers, merchants, bootblacks, waitresses, etc. They bought stocks on tips, did not know what the company sold or made and did not know how to investigate a stock.

Immediately after the 1929 crash the speculators rushed in to buy "bargains" but were badly mistaken because the market kept going down and down even tho industrial leaders kept on assuring the people that everything was fine and the worst was over. **At the present time the newspapers are urging people to buy these "bargains" but opinion is much divided as to whether or not the bottom has been reached.**

The worst feature about real estate in a depression is that it is illiquid and cannot be sold at any price. If it is free of mortgage the owner may hold on until normal times - but in most cases it is subject to mortgage.

Only the blue chip stocks are still high. It seems there should be no rush to buy bargains in a panic. The opportunities are many and the period is often protracted.

##### July 30, 1931

Magazines and newspapers are full of articles telling people to buy stocks, real estate at present bargain prices. They say that times are sure to get better and that many big fortunes have been built this way. The trouble is that nobody has any money.

> This advice was premature. A year later prices are 1/3 of what they were in 1931.

> In addition, a worldwide cratering of prices on commodities - coffee, cotton, rubber and wheat had all fallen more than 50% since the stock market crash.

##### August 20, 1931

This morning a client 65 years of age came. He had been in the liquor business and in 1921 when Prohibition put an end to his activity he had accumulated about $200,000 in liquid cash. He is now broke. He became a prey to high pressure salesmen of worthless stocks, tried one business after the other; speculated in real estate and in many ways tried to make more money quickly. With tears in his eyes he said he would preserve and protect the principal at all hazards. He would invest safely for a small but certain return. He was particularly rabid against his investments in real estate.

##### September 2, 1931

Must have liquid capital in time of depression to buy the bargains and then he must sell before the next crash. Buying stocks when they are selling far below their intrinsic value and nobody wants them, and of selling his stocks when people are bidding frantically for them at prices far above their intrinsic value. Among such investors are the Morgans, the Mellons and the Bakers. Their secret to a large extent lies in having liquid capital available and the courage to invest when things look the blackest. 

##### September 10, 1931

AT&T is still paying its $9 dividend and has proven to be an outstanding stock. I feel more and more convinced that **the time to buy stocks has not yet arrived because the blue chip stocks have not yet come down** even tho the depression is already two years old.

##### October 10, 1931

**In prosperous times a man must be cautious and preserve his capital and be careful not to overexpand his business or to go too deeply in debt** relying on a continuation of good business to pay the debt. A great many losses and failures in business and in investment are due to the reversal of this policy. At the height of prosperity they rush into buy stocks or real estate or businesses at boom prices and assume enormous indebtedness which can be liquidated only if the boom spiral mounts higher and higher. Then comes an abrupt end to prosperity - a cash - and down go these businesses and investments purchased at top prices. If the purchase was made mostly with borrowed capital as so often happens - then you can write finis to the chapter.

### Volume 2 - October 20, 1931 - November 11, 1932

##### November 24, 1931

> Construction of residential properties saw an 82% drop in 1929 to 1932. U.S. Steel Corporation had cut 75% of its workforce to part-time hours in 1931.

> Farmers financed much of the expansion during the good times by remortgaging their properties with easy loans from banks. They also snatched up modern plows, cultivators, tractors, and other equipment aimed at boosting productivity when demand was high on credit from farming companies.

### Volume 3 - November 19, 1932 - April 22, 1933 **Business is at an absolute standstill.**

##### Chapter 4 : April 26, 1933 - December 28, 1933 - "The depression has been broken"

##### December 28, 1933

**"Our Mysterious Panics"** by Colman: Every panic is brought on by human greed and speculation instead of by complex economic cycles:
1. After a depression comes a slow return to normal.
2. A few years of "normal business", men get too optimistic and begin to over expand, speculate, etc.
3. Speculation leads to fraudulent stock issues, embezzlement, new theories such as "new era".
4. Then comes the crash or panic caused by over-expansion, fraud, embezzlement and human greed.

##### Chapter 5: January 10, 1934 - November 6, 1936

Wealthy banker George F.Baker:

1. He always bought sound stocks and bonds when they were offered below intrinsic value.
2. He always had liquid cash for such a purpose.
3. After he bought such stocks and bonds he held on "until the cows came home." He never made a practice of speculative buying and selling and never tried to catch the market swings.
4. He never sold unless the stock market was going bad or the price offered was too good to refuse.

Many who understood did not have the money. **Others who had money did not see the opportunity or were afraid to risk their money when things looked so black.**

History will repeat itself and the chart of the old depression will foretell pretty accurately the course of the new. You will be told that this new depression is different because of government control, etc. But as long as human nature is the same and people like to speculate, it is probable that in the future, economic booms and depressions will come and go as in the past.
