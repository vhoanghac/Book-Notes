# Drop Out and Get Schooled by Patrick Bet-David

## Prologue

Legislation thinks that an 18-year-old is old enough to go to war and use multi-million-dollar machinery to kill people you don’t know but apparently not old enough to sit around and have a beer afterward and talk about the people you just killed.  

Nothing about college is so big that poor grades or even dropping out were worth suicide.

## Chapter 1: Why we go to college

Education is broken, and most graduates are broke. We are a mob of robots merely following our programming.

Approximately 30% of the students who stepped foot into high school as freshmen will graduate from college.

 the class of 2015 is carrying the most student debt in U.S. history, an average of $35,000 EACH.
 
 Entitlement is the new heroin, and our leaders are the drug dealers
 
 College has simply become an industry unto itself and a convenient way for certain political agendas to be passed on to the next generation.
 
 Open a dialogue with their friends by asking “why” they have chosen a college or major and keep asking why until you are convinced the friend is committed and passionate.  Any answer about choosing a college that begins with a “B” is usually trouble:
 
 education is a multi-billion-dollar industry driving to earn its revenue just like any other industry.
 
 Very few professors have worked in the private sector, and that’s a problem unto itself.   It’s easy to talk about systems to discipline employees, but it is a different thing to look someone in the eye and terminate their employment. 
 
 If you need to go to college to make friends or useful life contacts in a world equipped with LinkedIn and Facebook, there’s something very wrong.  
 
 ## Chapter 2: Who should go to college?
 
 High-end sciences are BEST learned at a college where labs and resources are available to teach and hone necessary skills. 
 
 You should go to college if:
 
 * You get an athletic scholarship
 * You are lazy
 * You know exactly what you want in life
 * You have a habit of not finishing things
 * 
 
 ## Chapter 3: Why should you not go to college?
 
 People who are not interested in engineering, sciences or medicine may find a faster path to their vision without college. 
 
 Everyone who fails to try when their gut says “TRY!” will almost certainly regret not trying.
  
 If you have a strong work ethic and have a sense of direction, college may not be a place to refine your understanding or direction. 
  
 If you are great in sales, you should consider skipping college
 
 Working in sales will teach you valuable transferable skills, pad your resume, and above all pad your wallet with unlimited income potential
 
 If you're rebellious, and self-disciplined
 
 There is no need to stress over anything so seriously, let alone school
 
 The institutions we have built to prop us up seem mostly to hold creative and forward thinking people back. College is great, but it is slow and routine. Accomplishments like a degree or a job are not an end; they are a means to an end. I’m so glad I learned that.
 
 ## Chapter 4: The Business of College  
 
 Colleges are accepting students who they know are going to drop out.
 
 Wages have risen 5X while the annual tuition cost of public university or private college has risen 18X
 
 Today, the interest rates on student loans are currently higher than basic 30-year mortgages which are insured by a different branch of the same federal government handling the student loans.
 
 Since 2006, the cost of a college textbook has increased by 73 percent — or more than four times the rate of inflation — according to Covering the Cost, a new report from the non-profit Student PIRGs (Public Interest Research Groups).
 
 I went and got one of the textbooks that cost $200 to purchase and sent it to a good friend of mine who prints books for a living.  I asked him to send me an estimate of what it would cost for me to order 5,000 copies of that same exact textbook.  My goal was to figure out what the universities cost was for these books.  She called me and told me that they could do it for roughly $5 a copy.
 
 ## Chapter 5: Before You Drop Out
 
 Have a plan
 
 Here are 5 things you need to do if you want to dropout of college:
 
 1. Have a source of support or plan to generate adequate income
 2. Learn Sales
 3. Learn self-discipline
 4. Work under a CEO entrepreneur for free
 5. Start a business - launch an entrepreneurial effort
 
Everything around you was built and designed by other dropouts who couldn’t stand for the status quo. Learn by doing, not through a textbook.

## Chapter 6: What should be added to college?

Create:

* A curriculum that matches the personality types of the students. 
* An experience where you find early on which kids gravitate towards entrepreneurship
* Low cost universities where anyone can get educated on any subject

Minimize: 
* Testing
* Time needed to get the degree

Increase:
* Education on life subjects (e.g. marriage, parenting, seeking a new job)

Eliminate:
* Negative mindset

## Chapter 7: How to Process Your Decision

Whatever you decide, know why you did it

1. What do I enjoy doing that I can see myself doing long term?
2. What can I do to maximize the amount of income I can make while doing this?
3. Do I need a college degree to do what I want to do?
4. Do I want to be an employee or an entrepreneur?

As long as you are doing your best with the situation you are in and the resources available to you, you can and should be proud of your answer
