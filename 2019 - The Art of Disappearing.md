### 1. The Big Picture

Whether you work or meditate, please accept that things will go wrong from time to time. Your job is not to ask for things the world can't give you. Your job is to observe. Your job is not to try to prod and push this world to make it just the way you like it to be. Your job is to understand, accept, and let it go. The more you fight your body, your mind, your family, and the world, the more collateral damage you'll cause and the more pain you'll experience.

When we understand and stand back from our daily lives, we see the big picture. We see there's nothing wrong with the monastery, nothing wrong with us, nothing wrong with life. We understand that it's just the nature of the world to go "wrong" - that's what the Buddha meant by the first noble truth of suffering. You work, struggle, and strive so hard to make your life just right-to make your home, your body, and your mind just right- and it goes wrong way.
