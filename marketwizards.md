# Market Wizards, Updated Interviews With Top Traders

## PREFACE

**The efficient market hypothesis**

> Weak efficiency. This form of the efficient market hypothesis states that past market price data cannot be used to beat the market. **Which mean: Technical analysis is a waste of time**.

> You can't beat the market using any publicly available information. **Which mean: Fundamental analysis is also a waste of time.**

Sometimes emotions will cause prices to wildly overshoot any reasonable definition of fair value.
At other times, emotions will cause prices to plunge far below any reasonable definition of fair value.

Market prices completely out of line with any plausible valuations are a common occurrence.

The efficient market hypothesis appears to be deeply flawed on both theoretical and empirical grounds.


## Chapter 1: Marcus

Marcus said: 
>As soon as it knew that I was in, the market took that as a signal to start descending.
We're not doing too well, let's get out!

He lost about $100 on that trade.

**Did you know anything at all about what you were doing? Had you read anything about comodities or trading?**
>No, nothing.

**Did the thought ever enter your mind that maybe trading was not for you?**
>No. I had always done well at school. But I knew I really needed to **learn something before trading** again. I read Chester Keltner's books. I followed the first recommendation, it was my first win and very exciting.

**How did you decide when to take profits?**
>I took some on the way up and some when the markets started coming down.
------------------------------
###### Talking about 1971

**Did you think of getting out on the way down before the market was locked limit-down?**
>I felt that I should get out, but I just watched. The next morning, I liquidated my entire position on the opening.

**How much did you lose on the trade?**
>I lost my own $30,000, plus $12,000. That was my lesson **in betting my whole wad**

**What did you do then?**
>I was really **upset**. I decided I had to go to work. I couldn't seem to get any job. I learned that **if you shoot for what you want, you stand a much better chance of getting it because you care much more**.

**Did you know what you were doing wrong then?**
>I **had no real grasp of trading principles**. Then I met Ed, he was basically a trend follower.
>I think I wasn't **patient** enough to wait for a clearly defined situation.
--------------------------------
**The best trades are the ones in which you have all three things going for you: fundamentals, technicals, and market tone.**
1. The fundamentals should suggest that there is an imbalance of supply and demand.
2. The chart must show that the market is moving in the direction that the fundamentals suggest.
3. When news comes out, the market should act in a way that reflects the right psychological.

Ex: A bull market should shrug off bearish news and **respond vigorously** to bullish news. If you can restrict your activity to only those types of trades, you have to make money, in any market.

**There will always be trades that meet those requirements, but there maybe fewer of them, so you have to be much more patient.**

--------------------------------

**Advice for beginning trader or a losing trader?**
1. **Only bet less than 5% of your money on any one idea.** That way you can be wrong more than 20 times.
2. Always use stop.
3. If a position doesn't feel right as soon as you put it on, don't be embarrassed to change your mind and get right out. You can always come back in. When in doubt, get out and get a good night's sleep.
4. When you are in, you can't think. When you get out, then you can think clearly again.
5. **Hold on to your winners and cut your losers.**
6. I try to take their information without getting overly influenced by their opinion.
7. When the news is wonderful and a market can't go up, then you want to be sure to be short.
8. The market is bigger than anybody and, sooner or later, it goes where it wants to go.
9. Being a successful trader also takes courage: the courage to try, to **courage to fail**, the courage to succeed, and the courage to keep on going when the going gets tough.
10. When you start losing, it touches off negative elements in your psychology; it leads to pessimism.

## Chapter 2: Bruce Kovner - The World Trader

You have to be willing to make mistakes regularly; there is nothing wrong with it. Making your best judgment, being wrong, making your next best judgment, being wrong, making your third best judgment, and then doubling your money.

**Technical analysis** tracks the past; it does not predict the future. 

Whenever I enter a position, I have a predetermined stop. **If the market is in the midst of trading range, it makes no sense to put your stop within that range**, since you are likely to be taken out. I **always place my stop beyond some  technical barrier**.

>The stock market has far more short-term countertrends. After the market has gone up, it always wants to come down.

**Advice for novice traders**
1. Risk management is the most important thing to be well understood.
2. Undertrade. Whatever you think your position ought to be, cut it in at least in half.
3. Place your stops at a point that, if reached, will reasonably indicate that the trade is wrong, **not at a point determined primarily by the maximum dollar amount you are willing to lose.**
4. Avoid impulsive trading decisions (putting on an unplanned trade because a friend has just recommended it, **liquidating a position before the predetermined stop point is reached because of an adverse price movement.**)
5. Accept mistakes as significant traits of the winning trader.

## Chapter 3: Marcus Richard Dennis

>When you have a destabilizing loss, get out, go home, take a nap, but put a little time between that and your next decision.

>Avoid trying to catch up or double up to recoup losses. A certain amount of loss will affect your judgment, so you have to put some time between that loss and the next trade.

>Minimize your losses and try to preserver capital for those few instances when you can make a lot.

**Don't be too tied to history?**
>Right.

**Advice for novice trader**
1. Trade small.
2. Learn from your mistakes.
3. Don't be misled by the day-to-day fluctuations in your equity.
4. The times when you least want to think about trading -the losing periods- are precisely the times when you need to focus most on trading.

## Chapter 4: Paul Tudor Jones - The Art of Aggressive Trading.

>If you want to move a larposition, you don't wait until the market is in new high or low ground because very little volume may trade there if it is a turning point.

**What are the trading rules you live by?**

>Don't ever averate losers. Decrease your trading volume when you are trading poorly; increase your volume when you are trading well. Never trade in situations where you don't have control.

>If you have a long position that is making you umcomfortable, the solution is very simple: Get out, because you can always get back in. There is nothing better than a fresh start. 

Don't focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.

After big winning streaks, he is particularly cautious about getting overconfident.

Play great defense, not great offense.

## Chapter 5: Gary Bielfeldt

Gary began his trading career twenty-five years ago, with a mere $1000 investment. He does not believe in diversification. His trading philosophy is that you pick one area and become expert at it. 

He had the desire to become a full-time trader from the beginning, his tiny capital base restricted his trading to a part-time endeavor.  In those early years, he earned his living running a small brokerage office. 

>Staying with your winners and getting rid of your losers.

>Have a patience to wait for the right trade to come along.

## Chapter 6: Ed Seykota - Everybody Gets What They Want

**What are the elements of good trading?**
>Cutting losses.

**How do you handle a losing streak?**
>I handle losing streaks by trimming down my activity. I just wait it out. Trying to trade during a losing streak is emotionally devastating. Trying to play "catch up" is lethal.

>1.Cut losses. 2. Ride winners. 3.Keep bets small.

**Advice for novice trader**

1. Speculate with less than 10% of your liquid net worth. Risk less than 1% of your speculative account on a trade. This tends to keep the fluctuations in the trading account small, relative to net worth.
2. Risk no more than you can afford to lose, and also risk enough so that a win is meaningful.
3. Trend systems do not intend to pick tops or bottoms. They ride sides.
4. If you canâ€™t take a small loss, sooner or later you will take the mother of all losses.

## Chapter 7: Larry Hite

While you may not know what will happen tomorrow, you can have a very good idea what will happen over the long run.

No matter what information you have, no matter what you are doing, you can be wrong.

When the volatility of a market becomes so great that it adversely skews the expected return/risk ratio, we will stop trading that market.

If you argue with the market, you will lose.

If a market doesn't respond to important news in the way that it should, it is telling you something very important.

When a market makes a historic high, it is telling you something. No matter how many people tell you why the market shoudn't be that high, or why nothing has changed, the mere face that the price is at a new high tells you something has changed.

If you don't bet, you can't win. If you lose all your chips, you can't bet.

----------------------------------------------

## PART II : MOSTLY STOCKS

## Chapter 1: Michael Steinhardt

Good trading is a peculiar balance between the conviction to follow your ideas and the flexibility to regonize when you made a mistake.

You need to believe in something, but at the same time, you are going to be wrong a considerable number of times.

## Chapter 2: William O'Neil

**Anything is possible with persistence and hard work. It can be done, and your own determination to succeed is the most important element.**

98% of investors are unwilling to buy a stock at a new high. One of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher and what seems too low usually goes lower. 

95% of the stocks that performed best in our studies **had less than twenty-five million shares** of capitalization during the period when they had their best performance. 

A stock should never be sold short because its price looks too high. The idea is not to sell short at the top, but at the right time.


**How do you decide when to liquidate a winning stock position?**
> First, hold a stock as long as it is performing properly. It is never your thinking that makes big money, it's the sitting.

> The goal is to make substantial profits on your stocks and not be upset if the price continues to advance after you get out.

## Chapter 3: David Ryan

**Aren't those sometime the best buys - the stocks that noone is paying any attention to?**
> Sometimes. But many of those stocks stay down there for years and years. I would rather wait until they prove themselves by moving up to the $15 - $20 range.

**After you have reviewed the charts and written down the stocks that interest you, what do you look at next to screen your selection?**
> I look at the five-year earnings growth record and the last two quarters of earnings relative to the previous year's levels. The quarterly comparisons show you if there is any deceleration in the earnings growth rate. For example, a 30% growth rate over the last five years may look very impressive, but if the last two quarters earnings were only up to 10% - 15%, it warns you that the strong growth period may be over. 

**You actually prefer to buy a stock that has already doubled as opposed to a stock that is in a long base?**
> Yes, because that shows me there is something very unusual going on, and if the situation is that good, a doubling may just be the beginning. It is probably going to double again. To sum it up, I am looking for the strongest stocks in the market, in terms of both earnings and the technical picture.

> You can tell a lot by the volume. If the volume doubles one day and the stock moves to a new high, it is telling you a lot of people are interested in the stock and buying it.
