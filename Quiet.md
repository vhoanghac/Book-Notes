# Quiet: The power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking

### INTRODUCTION

Our lives are shaped as profoundly by personality as by gender or race. And the single most important aspect of personality - the "north and south of temperament" - is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum.

The Extrovert Ideal has been documented in many studies, though this research has never been grouped under a single name. Talkeative people, for example, are rated as smarter, better-looking, more interesting, and more desirable as friends.
Velocity of speech counts as well as volume: we rank fast talkers as more competent and likeable than slow ones.
