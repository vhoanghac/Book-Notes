# Money: Master The Game

## Section 1: Welcome to the Jungle

### Chapter 1.1: It's Your Money! It's your life! Take control

> How would you live your life if you could wake up each day knowing there was enough money coming in to cover not only your basic needs but also your goals and dreams? 
>
> A lot of us would keep working, because that's the way we're wired. Our work would continue, but the rat race would end. We'd work because we want to, not because we have to.
>
> **That's financial freedom.**

**One reason people succeed is that they have knowledge other people don't.**

ðŸ“ˆ Chasing returns never works, nobody beats the market long-term, the vast majority of financial experts don't have a legal responsibility to serve your best interests. The returns advertised by mutual funds are not the returns you actually earn. ðŸ“ˆ 

> "There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion."
>
> **-Ralph Waldo Emerson**

> "Typical money managers are not going to help you win because they don't have the skills or resources to play in the big game. If they did, you wouldn't have access to them."
>
> "Instead of trying to compete, you've gotta learn there is a passive way to win. There's a way to not put all your eggs in one basket. It's a system to protect yourself against all downsides, because the best investors know they're going to be wrong, no matter how smart they are."
>
> "What has been very successful for me through my whole life is to not be arrogant about knowing, but to embrace the fact that I have weaknesses; that I don't know a lot this, that, and the other thing. The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know."
>
> **-Ray Dalio**

### Chapter 1.2: The 7 simple steps to financial freedom: Create an income for life

Anticipation is the ultimate power. Losers react; leaders anticipate.

No matter where you live, if you don't have another source of income, you could end up the best-dressed greeter at Wal-Mart.

Whether or not we think we make good financial decisions, or poor ones, we assume we're in control of the dicisions we do make. Science would suggest we're not.

> "If you know your limitations, you can adapt and succeed. If you don't know them, you're going to get hurt.
>
> **-Ray Dalio**

### Chapter 1.3: Make the most important financial decision of your life

> "Before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you invest, investigate. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try. Before you retire, save. Before you die, give.
>
> **-William A.Ward**

You're already a financial trader. You might not think of it in just this way, but if you work for a living, you're trading your time for money. It's just about the worst trade you can make. You can always get more money, but you can't get more time.

ðŸ’° **The rest of your life will be determined by your decision to keep a percentage of your income today in order to always have money for yourself in your future.** ðŸ’°

When things are going well, it's human nature to think they're going to contiune going well forever! But when there's a meltdown, people run for the hills. They'll give away their homes, their stocks, their businesses for next to nothing. When things are going down, we think they're going to go down forever.

**A part of all I earn is mine to keep.**
