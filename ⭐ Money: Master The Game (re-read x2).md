# Money: Master The Game

## Section 1: Welcome to the Jungle

### Chapter 1.1: It's Your Money! It's your life! Take control

> How would you live your life if you could wake up each day knowing there was enough money coming in to cover not only your basic needs but also your goals and dreams? 
>
> A lot of us would keep working, because that's the way we're wired. Our work would continue, but the rat race would end. We'd work because we want to, not because we have to.
>
> **That's financial freedom.**

**One reason people succeed is that they have knowledge other people don't.**

📈 Chasing returns never works, nobody beats the market long-term, the vast majority of financial experts don't have a legal responsibility to serve your best interests. The returns advertised by mutual funds are not the returns you actually earn. 📈 

> "Instead of trying to compete, you've gotta learn there is a passive way to win. There's a way to not put all your eggs in one basket. It's a system to protect yourself against all downsides, because **the best investors know they're going to be wrong, no matter how smart they are.**"
>
> "What has been very successful for me through my whole life is to not be arrogant about knowing, but to embrace the fact that I have weaknesses; that I don't know a lot this, that, and the other thing. The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know."
>
> **-Ray Dalio**

### Chapter 1.2: The 7 simple steps to financial freedom: Create an income for life

**Anticipation is the ultimate power. Losers react; leaders anticipate.**

No matter where you live, if you don't have another source of income, you could end up the best-dressed greeter at Wal-Mart.

Whether or not we think we make good financial decisions, or poor ones, we assume we're in control of the decisions we do make. Science would suggest we're not.

### Chapter 1.3: Make the most important financial decision of your life

> "Before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you invest, investigate. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try. Before you retire, save. Before you die, give.
>
> **-William A.Ward**

When things are going well, it's human nature to think they're going to contiune going well forever! But when there's a meltdown, people run for the hills. They'll give away their homes, their stocks, their businesses for next to nothing. When things are going down, we think they're going to go down forever.

### Chapter 1.4: Money Mastery: It's time to break through

💰 **Money can't change who we are. All it does is magnnify our true natures.** 💰

Life is really about creating meaning. And meaning does not come from what you get, it comes from what you give. What you get never make you happy long term. But who you become and what you contribute will.

## Section 2: Become the insider: Know the rules before you get in the game

### Chapter 2.0: Break free.

Don't get in the game unless you know the rules. When it comes to your money, what you don't know can -and likely will- hurt you. Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is pain, Ignorance is struggle, Ignorance is giving your fortune away to someone who hasn't earned it.

> "Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."
>
> **- Warren Buffett**

### Chapter 2.1: Myth 1: "Invest with us. We'll beat the market"

> "The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners - neither he nor his "helpers" can do that - but should rather be to own a cross sectrion of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well."
>
> **- Warren Buffett**

Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass; it's about learning to dance in the rain. It's about removing the fear in this area of your life so you can focus on what matters most.

### Chapter 2.9: "The lies we tell ourselves"

The ultimate thing that stops most of us from making significant progress in our lives is not somebody else's limitations, but rather our own limiting perceptions or beliefs.

Cách nhanh nhất để có kết quả tốt nhất đó chính là tìm người nào đó giỏi về lĩnh vực bạn đang theo đuổi và bắt chước hành động của họ.

Looking for someone who has not developed real wealth is a recipe for disaster. It simply reinforces the belief that nothing will work.

Stories control our emotions, and emotions drive all of our behavior and actions.

Anyone who's become truly wealthy knows the truth - the only way to become wealthy, and stay wealthy, is to find a way to do more for others than anyone else is doing in an area that people really value.

We all get what we tolerate. So stop tolerating excuses within yourself, limiting beliefs of the past, of half-assed or fearful states.

## Section 3: What's the price of your dreams?

Life is not about money, it's about emotion. Money itself is not the goal. Our worth is not measured by the weight of our bank accounts but, rather, by the weight of our souls.

### Chapter 3.1: What's the price of your dreams?

Dream 1: Financial Security

1. Home morgage
2. Ultilities for home
3. Food
4. Transportation needs
5. Insurance costs

Dream 2: Financial Vitality

1. Half of your current monthly clothing costs
2. Half of your current monthly dining and entertainment costs
3. Half of your current small indulgence or little luxury costs

### Chapter 3.2: What's your plan?

What's most important is that you be honest with yourself. No rounding up here. No bending the truth.

There's no first place or last place. Life is not a competition. Often people use money and the acquisition of things to measure where they stand: nicer house, fancier car... But the truth is, we can't predict how long we'll live or the state of our health as we age. **It doesn't matter where we start. It's how we finish that count.**

**When you get around people who are playing the game of life at a higher level, you either get depressed, pissed off, or inspired.**

It isn't about the money. It's about choice; about freedom. It's about being able to live life on your terms, not anybody else's.

### Chapter 3.4: Speed it up. Earn more and invest the difference

**The real limitation in our earnings is never our job - it's our creativity, our focus, and our contribution.**

### Chapter 3.5: Reduce fees and taxes

It's not what you earn that matters, it's what you keep.


**Speed It Up!**
1. Save more and invest the difference
2. Earn more and invest the difference
3. Reduce fees and taxes and invest the difference
4. Get better returns
5. Change your lifestyle.

## Section 4: Make the most important investment decision of your life

When it comes to money, delusions that you're better than everybody else can kill you.

### Chapter 4.3: The Dream Bucket

Dream Bucket: It's where you set aside something for yourself and those you love so that all of you cn enjoy life while you're building your wealth. Your Dream Bucket is meant to excite you.

### Chapter 4.4: Timing is everything?

If you think you can time the markets, you're wrong. Even the best in the world can't do it every time because there will always be factors they can't predict.

>"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves."

**Rebalancing Act**
60%: Rish/Growth Bucket
40$ Security Bucket.

==> ??? Reblance after 6 months or a year.

What do you do if you find that you're out of balance? You were 60% Risk/Growth and 40% Security, your stocks have soared, and you're now 75%/25% as a result. 

In this case, your rebalancing action plan requires you to shift your regular contributions to the Risk/Growth Bucket into Security until the 25% is back up to 40%.

--- 

1. Asset allocation is everything! You want to diversify across asset classes, markets, and time.
2. **You don't want to hesitate to get in the market trying to have perfect timing; instead, use dollar-cost averaging and know that volatility can be your friend**.
3. Have a Dream Bucket that gives you emotional juice and excitement so you can experience the benefits of your investing prowess in the short term and midterm instead of just someday far in the future.
4. Rebalancing.

## Section 5: Upside without the downside: Create a lifetime income plan

### Chapter 5.1: Invincible, unsinkable, unconquerable: The all seasons strategy.
