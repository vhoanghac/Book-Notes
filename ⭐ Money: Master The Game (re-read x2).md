# Money: Master The Game

## Section 1: Welcome to the Jungle

### Chapter 1.1: It's Your Money! It's your life! Take control

> How would you live your life if you could wake up each day knowing there was enough money coming in to cover not only your basic needs but also your goals and dreams? 
>
> A lot of us would keep working, because that's the way we're wired. Our work would continue, but the rat race would end. We'd work because we want to, not because we have to.
>
> **That's financial freedom.**

**One reason people succeed is that they have knowledge other people don't.**

ðŸ“ˆ Chasing returns never works, nobody beats the market long-term, the vast majority of financial experts don't have a legal responsibility to serve your best interests. The returns advertised by mutual funds are not the returns you actually earn. ðŸ“ˆ 

> "Instead of trying to compete, you've gotta learn there is a passive way to win. There's a way to not put all your eggs in one basket. It's a system to protect yourself against all downsides, because **the best investors know they're going to be wrong, no matter how smart they are.**"
>
> "What has been very successful for me through my whole life is to not be arrogant about knowing, but to embrace the fact that I have weaknesses; that I don't know a lot this, that, and the other thing. The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know."
>
> **-Ray Dalio**

### Chapter 1.3: Make the most important financial decision of your life

> "Before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you invest, investigate. Before you criticize, wait. Before you pray, forgive. Before you quit, try. Before you retire, save. Before you die, give.
>
> **-William A.Ward**

When things are going well, it's human nature to think they're going to contiune going well forever! But when there's a meltdown, people run for the hills. They'll give away their homes, their stocks, their businesses for next to nothing. When things are going down, we think they're going to go down forever.

### Chapter 1.4: Money Mastery: It's time to break through

ðŸ’° **Money can't change who we are. All it does is magnnify our true natures.** ðŸ’°

Life is really about creating meaning. And meaning does not come from what you get, it comes from what you give. What you get never make you happy long term. But who you become and what you contribute will.

Don't get in the game unless you know the rules. When it comes to your money, what you don't know can -and likely will- hurt you. Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is pain, Ignorance is struggle, Ignorance is giving your fortune away to someone who hasn't earned it.

> "Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."

### Chapter 2.1: Myth 1: "Invest with us. We'll beat the market"

> "The goal of the nonprofessional should not be to pick winners - neither he nor his "helpers" can do that - but should rather be to own a cross sectrion of businesses that in aggregate are bound to do well."
>
> **- Warren Buffett**

Life isn't about waitingf for the storm to pass; it's about learning to dance in the rain. It's about removing the fear in this area of your life so you can focus on what matters most.
