# Money: Master The Game

## Section 1: Welcome to the Jungle

### Chapter 1.1: It's Your Money! It's your life! Take control

> How would you live your life if you could wake up each day knowing there was enough money coming in to cover not only your basic needs but also your goals and dreams? 
>
> A lot of us would keep working, because that's the way we're wired. Our work would continue, but the rat race would end. We'd work because we want to, not because we have to.
>
> **That's financial freedom.**

**You have to make the shift from being a consumer in the economy to becoming an owner - and you do it by becoming an investor.**

One reason people succeed is that they have knowledge other people don't.

Chasing returns never works, nobody beats the market long-term, the vast majority of financial experts don't have a legal responsibility to serve your best interests. The returns advertised by mutual funds are not the returns you actually earn. 

> "There is no friend as loyal as a book."

> **-Ernest Hemingway**

> "There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion."
>
> **-Ralph Waldo Emerson**

> "Typical money managers are not going to help you win because they don't have the skills or resources to play in the big game. If they did, you wouldn't have access to them."
>
> "Instead of trying to compete, you've gotta learn there is a passive way to win. There's a way to not put all your eggs in one basket. It's a system to protect yourself against all downsides, because the best investors know they're going to be wrong, no matter how smart they are."
>
> "What has been very successful for me through my whole life is to not be arrogant about knowing, but to embrace the fact that I have weaknesses; that I don't know a lot this, that, and the other thing. The more you learn, the more you realize you don't know."
>
> **-Ray Dalio**

### Chapter 1.2: The 7 simple steps to financial freedom: Create an income for life

Anticipation is the ultimate power. Losers react; leaders anticipate.

No matter where you live, if you don't have another source of income, you could end up the best-dressed greeter at Wal-Mart.
