# Why we work

### The Crucial Question

Satisfied workers are engaged by their work. They lose themselves in it. They do their work because they feel that they are in charge. These people are satisfied with their work because they find what they do meaningful.

We wouldn’t work if we didn’t get paid, but that’s not at the core of why we do what we do. And in general, we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for working. Indeed, when we say of someone that “he’s in it for the money,” **we are not merely being descriptive; we’re passing judgment.**

## When Work Is Good

Confronted with evidence that so few people in the world get satisfaction from their work, we need to ask why. 
1. Many of us believe that only certain kinds of jobs permit people to find meaning, engagement, discretion, and autonomy, and opportunities to learn and grow.
2. We might take the view that pretty much every job has the potential to offer people satisfying work. 

### Cleaning Hospitals

> Luke: Yeah, I cleaned it so that he could see me clean it . . . I can understand how he could be. It was like six months that his son was here. He’d be a little frustrated, and so I cleaned it again. But I wasn’t angry with him. I guess I could understand.

What Luke sought in his work was shaped by the aims *—what Aristotle would call the telos—* of his organization. The telos of the hospital *—promoting health, curing illness, relieving suffering—* was embedded in Luke’s approach to his job. 

**They understood and internalized these aims in spite of their official job description, not because of it.**

> Ben, another custodian, told the researchers how he stopped mopping the hallway floor because a patient who was recovering from major surgery was out of his bed getting a little much-needed exercise by walking slowly up and down the hall. 

> Corey told them about how he ignored his supervisor’s admonitions and refrained from vacuuming the visitors’ lounge while some family members, who were there all day, every day, happened to be napping.

These custodians shaped their jobs with the central purpose of the hospital in mind.

**Job crafting** is what Wrzesniewski and her colleagues called it. Luke, Ben, and Corey were not generic custodians; they were hospital custodians. **They saw themselves as playing an important role in an institution whose aim is to see to the care and welfare of patients.**

So, when Luke was confronted by the angry father and he had to decide what to do, he could not look the answer up in his official job description because the rules that defined his job said nothing about situations like this. **What guided him was the aim of the job he had crafted.**

**What is it that enabled Luke to do work like this?**
1. Luke’s job gave him broad discretion when it came to social interactions with the patients. He didn’t have a supervisor looking over his shoulder every minute.
2. Empathy, good listening, and perceptiveness.
3. Luke believed in the purposes of the enterprise of which he was a part. A belief like this helped make his work meaningful.

> "To be satisfied with our work, we typically need a belief in the purpose of what we do".

**Amy Wrzesniewski calls work that has such characteristics a “calling” and distinguishes it from work that is a “job” or a “career.”**

- People who see their work as a **“job”** enjoy little discretion and experience minimal engagement or meaning. People with jobs see work as a necessity of life, they work for pay, they would switch jobs if given the chance to earn more money, they can’t wait to retire, and they would not encourage their friends or children to follow in their footsteps. They are the embodiment of Adam Smith’s ideas about people’s attitudes toward work.

- People who see their work as a **“career”** generally enjoy more discretion and are more engaged. They may even enjoy what they do. But their focus is on advancement. They see themselves as following a trajectory that leads to promotion, higher salary, and better work

- **"calling"**: work is one of the most important parts of life, they are pleased to be doing it, it is a vital part of their identity, they believe their work makes the world a better place, and they would encourage their friends and children to do this kind of work. People whose work is a calling get great satisfaction from what they do.*

**What, then, determines how people think about their work?**
Depends on *characteristics of the person*. That is, differences in the way people approach their work are explained by the attitudes they bring to their work—who they are, not what the work is. 

But the kind of work one does is also a major factor. It is easier to find meaning and engagement in some kinds of work than in others.

### Making Carpet

You don’t need to be working for an organization that saves lives to find meaning and purpose in what you do. You just need to be doing work that makes people’s lives better.

### Cutting Hair

To have a job that you are happy—even eager—to do.
- It helps if the work itself is challenging, varied, and engaging.
- It helps if the work gives you the **chance to use your skills and develop more skills.** 
- It helps if you **have discretion over how you do your job.**
- It helps if you feel that you are part of a group, with fellow workers you respect. 
- And most important, it helps if **the work is aimed at a goal that is valuable and gives the work you do meaning and purpose.**

### Turning a "Vicious Cycle" into a "Virtuous Cycle"

The knee-jerk response to competitive pressure —cutting staff, speeding up workers, monitoring performance closely— makes
the situation worse, by reducing the effectiveness (and the satisfaction) of the workforce.

**Paying attention to enhancing the character of work creates what we might call a virtuous cycle.**

When people find engagement and meaning in the work they do, it makes them happy to go to work. When people are happy, they work better and they work smarter.
