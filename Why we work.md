# Why we work

#### The Crucial Question

Satisfied workers are engaged by their work. They lose themselves in it. They do their work because they feel that they are in charge. These people are satisfied with their work because they find what they do meaningful.

We wouldn’t work if we didn’t get paid, but that’s not at the core of why we do what we do. And in general, we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason for working. Indeed, when we say of someone that “he’s in it for the money,” **we are not merely being descriptive; we’re passing judgment.**

## When Work Is Good

Confronted with evidence that so few people in the world get satisfaction from their work, we need to ask why. 
1. Many of us believe that only certain kinds of jobs permit people to find meaning, engagement, discretion, and autonomy, and opportunities to learn and grow.
2. We might take the view that pretty much every job has the potential to offer people satisfying work. 

### Cleaning Hospitals

> Luke: Yeah, I cleaned it so that he could see me clean it . . . I can understand how he could be. It was like six months that his son was here. He’d be a little frustrated, and so I cleaned it again. But I wasn’t angry with him. I guess I could understand.

What Luke sought in his work was shaped by the aims *—what Aristotle would call the telos—* of his organization. The telos of the hospital *—promoting health, curing illness, relieving suffering—* was embedded in Luke’s approach to his job. **They understood and internalized these aims in spite of their official job description, not because of it.**

> Ben, another custodian, told the researchers how he stopped mopping the hallway floor because a patient who was recovering from major surgery was out of his bed getting a little much-needed exercise by walking slowly up and down the hall. 
> Corey told them about how he ignored his supervisor’s admonitions and refrained from vacuuming the visitors’ lounge while some family members, who were there all day, every day, happened to be napping.

These custodians shaped their jobs with the central purpose of the hospital in mind.
