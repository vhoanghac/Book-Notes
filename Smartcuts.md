#### Chapter 1: Hacking the ladder

The players eliminated resistance by breaking the big challenge into a series of easier, repeatable challenges. Researchers call this the psychology of "small wins". Gambers would call it a "parlay" (A cumulative series of bets in which winnings accruing from each transaction are used as a stake for a further bet).

#### Chapter 2: Training with masters

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentor_(Odyssey)
>In the Odyssey, Mentor was the son of Alcimus. In his old age Mentor was a friend of Odysseus who placed him and Odysseus' foster-brother Eumaeus in charge of his son Telemachus, and of Odysseus' palace, when Odysseus left for the Trojan War.
>
>When Athena visited Telemachus she took the disguise of Mentor to hide herself from the suitors of Telemachus's mother Penelope. As Mentor, the goddess encouraged Telemachus to stand up against the suitors and go abroad to find out what happened to his father. When Odysseus returned to Ithaca, Athena appeared briefly in the form of Mentor again at Odysseus' palace. 

We can spend thousands of hours practicing until we master a skill, or we can convince a world-class practitioner to guide our practice and cut the time to mastery significantly.

Data indicates that those who train with successful people who've "been there" tend to achieve success faster. The winning formula, it seems, is to seek out the world's best and convince them to coach us.
