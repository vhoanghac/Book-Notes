#### Chapter 1: Hacking the ladder

The players eliminated resistance by breaking the big challenge into a series of easier, repeatable challenges. Researchers call this the psychology of "small wins". Gambers would call it a "parlay" (A cumulative series of bets in which winnings accruing from each transaction are used as a stake for a further bet).

#### Chapter 2: Training with masters

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentor_(Odyssey)
>In the Odyssey, Mentor was the son of Alcimus. In his old age Mentor was a friend of Odysseus who placed him and Odysseus' foster-brother Eumaeus in charge of his son Telemachus, and of Odysseus' palace, when Odysseus left for the Trojan War.
>
>When Athena visited Telemachus she took the disguise of Mentor to hide herself from the suitors of Telemachus's mother Penelope. As Mentor, the goddess encouraged Telemachus to stand up against the suitors and go abroad to find out what happened to his father. When Odysseus returned to Ithaca, Athena appeared briefly in the form of Mentor again at Odysseus' palace. 

We can spend thousands of hours practicing until we master a skill, or we can convince a world-class practitioner to guide our practice and cut the time to mastery significantly.

Data indicates that those who train with successful people who've "been there" tend to achieve success faster. The winning formula, it seems, is to seek out the world's best and convince them to coach us.

The best mentors help students to realize that the things that really matter are not the big and obvious.

#### Chapter 3: Rapid Feedback

Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.

Japan: "People don't try if they think they might fail."

It turns out that after you adjust for statistical margin of error, an entrepreneur who'd failed in a previous venture was not likely to do better than someone who'd never run a business in her/his life. Arcording to the study, successful entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are 50% more likely to succeed in a second venture.

The uncertainty is so overwhelming that the experience that you have from a previous company doesn't seem to have a significant impact on the actual success of a (second) company.

Failing in business doesn't make us better or smarter. But succeeding make us more likely to continue to succeed.
