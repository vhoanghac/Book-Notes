# Your Money & Your Brain - Jason Zweig

### Chapter 1 - Neuroeconomics

You will never maximize your wealth unless you can optimize your mind.

In theory, the more we learn about our investments, and the harder we work at understanding them, the more money we will make. In practive, however, those assumptions often turn out to be dead wrong.

Our investing brains often drive us to do things that make no logical sense - but make perfect emotional sense. That does not make us irrational. It makes us human.

No matter how much or how little you may think you know about investing, there is always more to learn about the final financial frontier: yourself.

### Chapter 2 - "Thinking" and "feeling"

The people who bought these stocks did not analyze the underlying business; instead, they went oin a feeling, a sensation, a hunch.

Investment choices are seldom simple and the keys to success can be very unstable. Bonds do well for a while and then, as soon as you buy them, they generate lousy returns; your emerging-market stock fund loses money for years and then, right after you bail out, it doubles in value.

**The only rule that appears to apply is Murphy's Law: whatever can go wrong will go wrong.**

Depending on how much the stocks fluctuated, investors who focused on price levels earned between five and ten times higher profits than those who paid attention to price changes. That's because the investors who fixated on price changes traded too much, trying to shave profits off the interim fluctuation.

The most critical factor in the future performance of a mutual fund is the small, relatively static number: its fees and expenses. Performance and reputation have almost no power to predict a fund's return but they are more vivid and changeable than the fund's expenses.

`Know when reflex will rule`: When the financial markets are quietly muddling along, it's easier for reflective judgment to prevail over flexive intuitions. But when bull markets are pumping or when bear markets are generating demoralizing losses, the reflexive system gets the upper hand and it becomes urgently important to think twice.

### Chapter 4 - Prediction

People tend to base their predictions of long-term trends on surprisingly short-term samples of data.

As soon as stock seems to conform to a pattern that has made money before, an "I-got-it" effect kicks in, making investors feel sure they know what's coming next. (pg.67)

### Chapter 5 - Confidence

Being overconfident isn't all bad.

>"If we were always realistic about our chances of success, we would never take any risks.
> - Daniel Kahneman

We can make a level-headed estimate of the typical person's odds of succeeding at something, but we usually have our heads in the clouds when we size up our own chances at success.

The main reason we insist we know more than we do is that admitting our ignorance undermines our self-esteem.

By embracing your mistakes instead of burying them, you can transform them from liabilities into assets. Studying your mistakes and keeping them in plain sight will help you avoid repeating them.

It takes so much confidence to admit that you aren't confident.

An investor who has no confidence will never invest at all/ Your goal is to be as sure as possible that you don't think you know more than you really do.

### Chapter 6 - Risk

How much risk you can stand depends on what mood you happen to be in.

When risk is framed negatively then it incites images and ignites emotions.

The main reason investors struggle with how to react to bad news is that they really haven't figured out why they own the stocks they own.

The riskiest moment is when you're right, that's when you're in the most trouble, because you tend to overstay the good decisions.

### Chapter 7 - Fear

You need to train yourself to turn your investing emotions upside down. Excitement becomes a cue that it's time to consider selling, while fear tells them that it may be time to buy.

### Chapter 8 - Surprise

Every investor should know that it's impossible to predict corporate earnings to the penny. Even so, people keep trying to do just that and end up being surprised again and again.

> "People make mistakes all the time. But the ones we really care about, and the ones we try hardest to avoid in the future, are the ones that have an important negative consequence."
> - William Gehring

### Chapter 9 - Regret

> "When you sell a loser, you don't just take a financial loss; you take a psychological loss from admitting you made a mistake. You are punishing yourself when you sell."
> - Daniel Kahneman

> "We would **rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of.**"
> - Hamlet

If you sell a favorite stock that you know well, you take an immediate hit to your self-esteem, and you might replace it with a less familiar one that loses you even more money. A petrified state in which you know you made one mistake but are afraid to do anything else, lest you make another.

Diversifying your money across other assets will always feel like a waste of effort. **It is a mistake to think you don't have to diversified.** No matter how many times you carry an umbrella without needing it, you will be very glad indeed to be carrying one when a downpour finally hits.

The more an outcome appears to be the result of your own choice and the more readily you can imagine having done something different, the more painful your regret is likely to be.

### Chapter 10 - Happiness

They found that how happy people say they *are* each day is not a good way to forecast howlong the relationship will last - but how happy people say they *were* is an excellent predictor of whether they will stay together.

The passage of time can smooth out the highs and lows, making you feel more satisfied with your life when you look back than you actually were while you were living it.

We often procrastinate the worst on things that are good for us. The upside only comes later; the downside is now. The emotional circuits in your reflexive brain fixate on the immediate costs, deterring your reflective brain from analyzing the future benefits.
