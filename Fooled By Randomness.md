# Fooled By Randomness

## Chapter 1: Solon's Warning.

Can we judge the success of people by their raw performance and their personal wealth? Sometimes - but not always.

**Lucky fools** do not bear the slightest suspicion that they maybe lucky fools. They will act as if they deserved the money. Their strings of successes will inject them with so much serotinin that they will even fool themselves about their **ability to outperform markets**.

Probability is about what may happen in the future, not events in the observed past.

### A Different Kind of Earthquake

People do not like to insure against abstract; the risk that merits their attention is always something vivid.

Our brain tends to go for superficial clues when it comes to risk and probability, these clues being largely **determined by what emotions and elicit or the ease with which they come to mind.**
Both risk detection and risk avoidance are not mediated in the "thinking" part of the brain but largely in the emotional one.

### The Stove Is Hot

Blown-up traders think that they knew enough about the world to reject the possibility of the adverse event taking place: There was no courage in their taking such risks, just ignorance. They all made claims to the effect that **"these times are different"** or that **"their market was different"** and offered seemingly well-constructed, intellectual arguments (of an economic nature) to justify their claims.

Our minds are not quite designed to understand how the world works, but, rather, to get out of trouble rapidly and have progency.

Those who are very good at *predicting* the past will think of themselves as good at predicting the future, **and feel confident about their ability to do so**. We live in a world where important events are not predictable.

### The difference between noise and information

The wise man listens to meaning; the fool only gets the noise

1. Over a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns.
2. Our emotions are not designed to understand that point. (If you think that you can control your emotions, think that some people also believe that they can control their heartbeat or hair growth).
3. When I see an investor monitoring his portfolio with live prices on his cellular telephone or his handheld, I smile and smile.

### A review of market fools of randomness constants

How they are fooled by randomness.

1. An overestimation of the accuracy of their beliefs in some measure, either economic and statistical.
2. A tendency to get married to positions.

Many people become long-term investors after they lose money, postponing their decision to sell as part of their denial.

### Naive Evolutionary theories

The strongest will survive; the weakest will become extinct. Darwinian ideas are about reproductive fitness, not about survival.

We do not live in a world where things "converge" continuosly towrd betterment. Nor do things in life move continuosly at all.

The longer these animals can go without encountering the rare event, the more vulnerable they will be to it.

### Skewness and asymmetry

Their success is linked to how often they are right or wrong.

Sometimes market data becomes a simple trap; it shows you the opposite of its nature, simply to get you to invest in the security or mismanage your risks.

Rare events exist precisely because they are unexpected. They are generally caused by panics, themselves the results of liquidations.

### The problem of induction

They trade on ideas based on some observation (that includes past history), they make sure that the costs of being wrong are limited.

## Chapter 2: Monkeys on typewriters

Those whose profession is to derive conclusions from data often fall into the trap faster and more confidently than others. The more data we have, the more likely we are to drown in it.

A small knowledge of probability can lead to worst results than no knowledge at all.

### Loser takes all on the nonlinearities of life

The straw that broke the camel's back.

The probability of success does not change with every incremental step, only the accumulated wealth.

Imagine a donkey equally hungry and thirsty placed at exactly equal distance from sources of food and water. He would die of both thirst and hunger as he would be unable to decide which one to get to first. 

### Randomness and our mind: We are probability blind

Your attitude toward the risks and rewards of the gamble will vary according to whether you look at your net worth or changes in it. But in fact **in real life you will be put in situations where you will only look at your changes. The fact that the losses hurt more than the gains.**

Anchoring effect: When something is in relation to something else, that something else can be manipulated. This anchoring to a number is the reason people do not react to their total accumulated wealth, but to differences of wealth from whatever number they are currently anchored to.
