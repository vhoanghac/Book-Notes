## Chapter 1 - This bubble world: The origins of financial speculation

### Vega's Confusion

>*"Some speculators are said to be of such a "nervous condition", and their behaviour so restless and fixated, that "even on their deathbed, their last worries are the shares."* 
> - **Vega**

>*"Speculators were full of instability, insanity, pride and foolishness. They will sell without knowing the motive; they will buy without reason."*
>- **Vega**

>*"The Market. All you have to do is look at the headlines or listen to the daily broadcast and you think you are hearing the latest medical report on someone who ought to be in therapy, on tranquilizers, or strapped down by attendants. It sounds like a manic-depressive psycho head case"*
>- **Mike Royko**

### Tulipomania

Tulipomania. House prices were also climbing sharply, producing a boom in the construction of suburban mansions. In the tulip, they found an object which enabled them to mix their love of display with the avid of pursuit of wealth.

The tulip lent itself to speculation: uncertainty surrounding its variegations (which, unknown to contemporaries, were caused by a virus that attacked the bulb).

The beginning of the tulipomania, is associated with the arrival in the tulip market around 1634 of outsiders who were apparently attracted by stories of rising prices for tulip bulbs. **Among these entrants to the market were weavers, spinners, cobblers, bakers, grocers, and peasants.**

---

Although the tulip craze grew to embrace most social classes, **two parties were absent.** 

1. `The wealthy amateur bulb collectors`, who had long shown a readiness to pay vast sums for the rarer varieties, **withdrew their custom as prices began to soar.**
2. `The great Amsterdam merchants` continued investing their trading profits in town houses, East India stock, or bills of exchange.

For them, **tulips remained merely an expression of wealth, not a means to that end.**

>* A Gouda bulb of four aces rose from 20 to 225 guilders; 
>* A Generalissimo of ten aces which had sold for 95 guilders fetched 900 guilders; 
>* A pound of plain yellow Croenen which sold for around 20 guilders rose in a few weeks to over 1200. 
>* **It has gone so far that the stuff which used to be weeded and thrown in basketfuls on the dung heap has been sold for heavy money.**

Those who had mortgaged their properties and exchanged their chattels for a chance of quick gain in the Tulipomania must have suffered a permanent loss of wealth.

### An affair of fools?

Common feature of bull markets that as mania progresses: `a rising tide floats all ship, even the most unseaworthy`, rumours fuelling the boom, the rapid growth of leverage through the use of futures and paper credit, conspicuous consumption among speculators, sharply rising prices followed by sudden panic without cause, and initial government passivity followed by belated intervention.

The Austrian economist J.A Schumpeter observed that `speculative manias commonly occur at the inception of a new industry or technology` when people overestimate the potential gains and too much capital is attracted to new ventures.

## Chapter 2 - Stockjobbing in Exhange Alley: the projecting age of the 1690s

>Nowhere does history indulge in repetitions so often or so uniformly as in Wall Street. When you read contemporary accounts of booms or panics, the one thing that strikes you most forcibly is how little either stock speculation or stock speculators today differ from yesterday.The game does not change and neither does human nature.
> - **Edwin Lefèvre, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1923)**

### Diving and floating in the early stock market

The craze of diving machines and treasure-seeking companies soon died down after their failure to salvage anything more than "a few Iron-Guns, Chimney Backs, and Ship's Tackle".

Many of these new companies were floated with patents for inventions. "An engine for quenching fire, the like whereof was never seen before in this kingdom", "a buglar alarm which it claimed could be set in a convenient place of any house, to prevent thieves from breaking in." **Arcording to a contemporary author, most of them were "mere whims, and of little or no service to the World.**

Look thee Lamb, between us, it's no matter whether it turns to any use or not; the main end verily is to turn the penny in the way of Stock-Jobbing, that's all.

### Gambling in the early capital markets

A lottery fever ensued with multitude of private lottery promotions. "Penny Lotteries" followed the larger promotions, and stockjobbers subdivided £10 tickets into smallers shares for the less well-off. By the middle of the decade, lottery tickets, like credit notes, **were circulating as currency.**

**Company of Mine Adventurers" illustrates the curious fusion of lottery gambling and stock market speculation.** Mackworth announced the conversion of the £20 ordinary shares into interest-paying bonds. `The incentitive for conversion was that each bond also served as a lottery ticket: one in ten bonds would receive a prize, the top prize being a package of shares and bonds with a prospective income of £2000 per annum.` Seven hundred proprietors were involved in the conversion and **more than four-fifths of the shares were converted in lottery bonds.**

### Headdresses and hemlines
(Giá cả là một thứ không có thực, nó hình thành dựa trên quyết định người mua bán hay nói cách khác cung và cầu)

>"Things have no value in themselves, it is opinion and fashion which brings them into use and gives them a value."
> - **Nicholas Barbon**

>"Market values - evanescent, ephemeral, and extravagant -were as much a reflection of passing fashion as female modes of attire. A fashionable style, like a speculative movement, is subject to a popular consensus and follows a trend until it reaches a point of extravagance from thich it can only retreat"
> - **Sir Richard Steele**

>"Nothing could be more useful, than to be well instructed in his Hope and Fears; to be different when others exalt, and with a secret joy buy when others think it their interest to sell.
> - **Sir Richard Steele**

**The Castles in the Air**: theory of value suggests that shares have no intrinsic value and share prices are simply product of investor psychology.

### The speculative paradigm

(Bản tính con người)

Shares were driven above their intrinsic values by speculators using financial derivaties (stock options and futures) as well as paper credit. The boom lost momentum after sanguine expectations were disappointed and doubtful enteprises failed. The collapse of share prices contributed to a severe economic crisis.

The modern investor is just as liable to be whipped up into a frenzy over companies introducing a new technology as the diving engine "cullies" of the Project Age.

## Chapter 3 - "The never-to-be-forgot or forgiven South-Sea scheme"

### The South Sea scheme

1. The higher the South Sea share price, the *fewer* shares were exchanged for annuities and the greater the profit to be divided between the company and the government.
2. The higher the value of the South Sea shares, the greater the market value of the shares received by the annuitants upon conversion.

In the South Sea bubble, some argued that the higher the shares rose, the more they were actually worth. People who bought surplus South Sea stock at its elevated price must be "deprived of all common Sense and Understanding.

### Devil take the hindmost

The inflated price of South Sea stock was not the most egregious example of investor irrationality. Bubble companies such as Globe Permits, giving the right to subscribe to a future sailcloth project, sold for £70 before the company had even been established. Shares in the older corporations also soared in the bull market: `the East India went from 100 to a high of 445`, `the Royal Africa from 23 to 200`. 

A recent historian of the South Sea Bubble sympathetically interprets the bubble companies as attempts to realise a vision of material and technological progress ahead of their time. `The machine gun` was eventually perfected and `Australia discovered`. `Steele's Fish-Pool` was genuine, if flawed, promotions, **but the great majority were fraudulent ventures designed to profit from the speculative euphoria.**

**Speculators did not buy bubble company shares as long-term investments; they bought them with the intention of selling them on to greater fools. In a very short time, however, they were discover that there were no greater fools in the market than themselves.**

### A rude awakening

1. **The Bubble Act** - which made illegal the establishment of companies without parliamentary permission and prevented existing companies from carrying on activities not specified by their charters.
2. **Scire Facias** - the directors of the South Sea Company issues a write for prosecution against three bubble companies which had diversified into areas not covered by their charters.
3. **Enhanced dividend** - The South Sea Company announced a dividend of 30% for the year, and a guaranteed 50% dividend for the next twelve years.

These three measures were intended to sustain the flagging South Sea share price but the publication of the **Scire Facias** brought panic to the stock market. 

> `York Buildings`, a water company that had diversified outside its charter into property development, collapsed from 305 to 30.

> The leading insurance companies, the `London Assurance` and the `Royal Exchange`, fell by over 75%.

Speculators who had purchased bubble company shares on credit were forced to sell their South Sea shares to make good their losses elsewhere. 

---

The initial fall had brought a "prodigious" Number of Sellers to the Market, one Man selling alarms another, and makes him sell, and thus the Stock has run down insensibly.

> *"They have dreamed out their dream, and awaking have found nothing in their hands.* Indeed the universal poverty, which is the consequence of universal avatice, and which will fall hardest upon the guiltless and industrious park of mankind, is lamentable."
> - **Alexander Pope, Bishop Atterbury**

## Chapter 4 - Fool's gold: The emerging markets of the 1820s

## Chapter 5 - A ready communication : The railway mania of 1845

### The canal mania

The advent of the railways represented a far more significant change in the life of man. It was anticipated that locomotives would prevent cows from grazing and hens from laying eggs, that their poisonous fumes would kill birds and blacken the fleeces of sheep, and that their speeds of up to fifteen miles an hour would blow passengers to atoms. Landlords feared for the tranquility of their estates. When the Great Western Railway was proposed to connect London with the west of England, both the University of Oxford and Eton College initially refused a connection. A rapidly expanding railway press contributed to the development of the popular enthusiasm.

## Chapter 6 - "Befooled, bewitched and bedeviled": Speculation in the gilded age

### War and Speculation

James Fisk, Jay Gould and Cornelius Vanderbilt were the heroes of the Gilded Age; their operations brought them national fame and their fortunes were the object of envious admiration. In a crisis, Vanderbilt's will was unbreakable and his purpose always firm.

> "All you have to do is buy cheap and sell dear, act with thrift and shrewdness and be persistent"
> - **Hetty Green**

Folwer depicted the amateur speculator as the "opinum-eater of finance", a man torn by conflicting passions, beset by uncertainty and fears, prone to buying high and selling low: "befooled, bewithched and bedeviled by what he hears in the market."

> "It is an adage in the stock market, the the outside public, as it is called, buys stocks when they are high, and sells them when they are low."
> - **Fowler**

Some speculators, known as "panic bird", came to the market only once prices had crashed and money was scarce; they bought carefully, locked up their investments, and kept away from Wall Street until the next calamity truck.

### New Exchanges, Old bubbles

Gold speculation reached a climiax in early 1864 when a new Gole Exchange opened. Since the prices of gold and other metals were rising faster than wages, it was natural that the attention of speculators should turn to mining.

### Milking the street

A corrupt press was a useful tool in the hands of a stock manipulator. Jay Gould controlled several newspaper editors, who in exchange for share tips would print whatever story he told them. When Jim Fisk was a director of the Erie Railroad, he sold short the stock of the United States Express Company, whic hhad a contract with the Erie, and then cancelled the contract. Once the express company's share price had fallen, Fisk covered his shorts, bought more shares, and then reinstated the contract. John "Bet-a-Million" Gates, who shut down his Chicago steel plant during a period of prosperity and put thousands out of work, claiming that the business was not making money. Like Fisk beforehand, Gates had sold the stock short and after making a killing in market, he reopened his factories.

### Jay Gould's Black Friday

End of the Civil War in 1865, the federal government was withdrawing greenbacks from circulation, which caused gold to fall from nearly 300 (i.e the number of greenbacks required to buy $100 in gold specie) in 1864 to around 130 in early 1869. As U.S exports were paid for in gold, the decline in the gold price made American grain more expensive in Europe.

### Jay Cooke's Black Thursday

The panic of Black Friday did not bring the era of speculation to a close. The railroads, in particular, continued to attract huge capital investment. This massive investment was fuelled by the anticipation that new railroads would product a rapid settlement of the uninhabited western territories. When the Union Pacific advertised the sale of its plots in Columbus, Nebraska, it lured potential purchasers with the prospect that "a fifty-dollar lot may prove a $5,000 investment".

Cooke set about hyping the land through a network of agents. His chieft publicist, a journalist named Sam Wilkerson, described the railroad's property as a "vast wilderness waiting like a rich heiress to be appropriated and enjoyed".

Uncertainty increased in August when several railroads experienced trouble refinancing their outstanding loans and newspapers carried stories of forged railroad bonds and shares in circulation. At the end of the first week in September, the New York Warehouse and Security Company announced its insolvency after making imprudent loans to certain western railroads.

18 September 1873, Jay Cook & Co. had failed. When the panic continued into Saturday, the president of the New York Stock Exchange announced that, for the first time in its history, the exchange would close until further notice. The Stock Exchange reopened after ten days. However, the nation dis not escape the consequences of over a decade of speculative excess and overinvestment. Throughout the following winter factories closed down, railroads discharged employees, banks failed, wages were cut, and money was hoarded.

## Chapter 7 - The end of a new era: The crash of 1929 and its aftermath

If the economic fundamentals of the country had changed and then it followed that these changes should be reflected in the stock market.

Edgar Lawrence Smith showed that stocks had outperformed bonds, especialy during the inflationary period of the first two decades of the twentieth century. Even when stocks were bought at a market peak. 

In the stock market the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more uncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw from them.

### Mortgaging the future

As the bull market continued, the Federal Reserve in Washington had inadvertently ignited the stock market boom by lowering interest rates in 1925. As long as the market continued rising, speculators were prepared to pay more for their margin loans. While interest rates remained too low to restrain speculation, they became too high for the economy.

### The madness of crowds

> Đặc điểm của đám đông là: bất khả chiến bại, vô trách nhiệm, sự bất lực, căn bệnh truyền nhiễm, hay thay đổi, đề xướng, sự ảo tưởng của tập thể và trí tuệ kém cỏi.
> **- Freud và Le Bon**

The crowd and the stock market have other features in common. They both thrive on uncertainty and rumour. Like the forces behind a bull market, the crowd is inherently unstable; it has no statis, no point of equilibrium, and is driven by a dynamic either to grow or to shrink. At the moment of its dispersal, a crowd frequently succumbs to panic: "It is of the very essence of a panic".

The intellectual inferiority of the crowd is a sign that people are filtering and manipulating new information to make it accord with their existing beliefs. 

## Chapter 8 - Cowboy Capitalism

### The Financial Revolution

Most commentators viewed advances in information technology as a boon. If markets were inherently efficient, they would become even more so when supplied with better information.

In the past the wider availability of financial information and improvements in communications have tended to attract impulsive new players to the speculative game.

The Internet has brought the stock market into the home, where it has thrived. Mobile phones, handheld trading devices, and on-line brokerage accounts have enabled investors to trade from anywhere in the world. This had led to the appearance of hordes of "day traders".

The information revolution has generated an extraordinary amount of fraud. Scattered across the worldwide web are literally hundreds of thousands of get-rich-quick investment scams. The Internet has become a forum for herdlike speculation. **"Momentum investment"**, the mindless practive of buying and selling stocks as they rise and fall with the market, is said to be a sign of investors' reaction to "information overload".

The people and their practices remain the same, only the language and technology are new. The speedier the communication, the faster the contagion spreads.

## Chapter 9 - Kamikaze Capitalism

### Manipulation in the Japanese stock market

The Tokyo Exchange was "the most cynical, speculative and manipulable stock market in the world".

Favoured clients who had lost heavily in the market were supplied with "ambulance shares" - stocks certain to rise - to heal their financial wounds.
