# Money: Master The Game

## Section 1: Welcome to the Jungle

### Chapter 1.1: It's Your Money!

> How would you live your life if you could wake up each day knowing there was enough money coming in to cover not only your basic needs but also your goals and dreams?

> A lot of us would keep working, because that's the way we're wired. Our work would continue, but the rat race would end. We'd work because we want to, not because we have to.

> **That's financial freedom.**

**You have to make the shift from being a consumer in the economy to becoming an owner - and you do it by becoming an investor.**

Chasing returns never works, nobody beats the market long-term, the vast majority of financial experts don't have a legal responsibility to serve your best interests. The returns advertised by mutual funds are not the returns you actually earn.
