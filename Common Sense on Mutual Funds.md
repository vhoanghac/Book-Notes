# Part 1 - On investment strategy

Investing is an act of faith, a willingness to postpone present consumption and save for the future.

## Chapter 1: On long-term investing

Excessive confidence in smooth seas can blind us to the risk of storms. History is replete with episodes in which the enthusiasm of investors has driven equity to the point at which they are swept into a whirlwind of speculation, leading to unexpected losses. 

### 1. The financial markets are not for sale

The long-term investor who pays least has the greatest opportunity to earn most of the real return provided by the stock market.

### 2. Practice Departs from Principle

Two pervasive short-term strategies show how mutual fund investors have followed them - to their detriment.
1. Market timing. Is apt to bring the opposite result: they are in the market for the dips, but out of the market for the rallies.
2. Rapid turnover of long-term invesment portfolios.

**Rather than ignoring the impulses engendered by the press or by emotional responses to market swings, the individual mutual fund shareholder responds to them with alacrity and follows the crowd.**

When stock prices are high, investors want to jump on the bandwagon; when stocks are on the bargain, it is difficult to give them away.

>*They withdrew $92 billion as stocks approached and recovered from their 2002 lows, only to pour in another $725 billion as the market seemed to recover through the autumn of 2007. The withdrawals began again, with $228 billion pulled out of equity funds through the low point in the market in the spring of 2009.* **Will the investors never learn?**

>"Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior. When 'dumb' money acknowledges its limitations, it ceases to be dumb."
**Warren Buffett**

Mutual funds and other financial institutions, they would rely on their specialized knowledge of investments and value stocks accurately, based on the prospective long-term merits of the stocks, not on the psychology of ignorant individuals. 

## Chapter 2: On the nature of returns

In developing a long-term investment strategy, remembering the past is essential, because it can help us to understand the forces that drive security prices.

>**Investment**: the activity of forecasting the prospective yield on the asset over its whole life... assuming that the existing state of affairs will continue indefinitely.

>**Speculation**: the activity of forecasting the psychology of the market... attaching hopes to a favorable change in the conventional basis of valuation.

## Chapter 4: On simplicity

The more complex the world around us becomes, the more simplicity we must seek in order to realize our financial goals.

Just as investors became captivated by those great pas returns, the fun was about to end. 

# Part 2 - On investment choices

## Chapter 8: On global investing

The moral of the story (Acres of diamonds) is clear and simple: stay home and dig in your own garden, instead of tempting fate in an alien world. You will find "acres of diamonds" right where you are.

China acconts for 18% of the world's population and 9% of its fross domestic product, and its economy has been growing at double-digit rates (10,6%) for the past five years. This could well make it the world's largest economy at some point during the 2020-2030 decade.

## Chapter 9: On selecting superior funds

Two poigant realities of the marketplace:
1. Investors as a group, do not, cannot, and will not beat the market
2. The overwhelming odds are against any particular mutual fund's doing so consistently over an investment lifetime.

# Part 3 - On investment performance

## Chapter 12: On asset size

The larger the assets, the larger the fees. And the management company's profits grow at a still higher rate, even as returns to fund shareholders are impaired. Because **the huge leverage of economies of scale has been arrogated by advisers to their own benefit rather than to the benefit of the fund shareholders they serve.**

## Chapter 14: On time

In the investment world, the importance of time in shaping returns has been honored more in the breach than in the observance - more in theory than in practice. We speak of the value of long-term investing, we say kind words about long-term investors. But, who comes to mind after Warren Buffett???
