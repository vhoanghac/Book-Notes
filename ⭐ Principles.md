# Principles - Ray Dalio

## PART 1 - Where I'm coming from.

People become pressimistic, so they sold their stocks and the market continued to fall. Things couldn't have gotten much worse but everyone was afraid they would.

In trading you have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. **If you are not aggressive**, you are not going to make money, and **if you are not defensive**, you are not going to keep money.

### Chapter 3: The Abyss

**The mistakes:**
- Wildy overcondifent
- The value of studying history.
- It is difficult to time market.

My crash was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it gave me the humility I needed to balance my aggressiveness.

Steve Jobs: *"It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did."*

### Chapter 5: The Ultimate Boon

No matter what asset class one held, there would come a time when it would lose most of its value. This included cash, which is the worst investment over time because it loses value after adjusting for inflation and taxes.

Having to much money to manage can hurt performance.

### Chapter 6: Returning The Boon

Dramatic stories and gossip draw more readers and viewers than does clinical objectivity. The politics are horrendous and distortions and outright misinformation from the media make things worse.

A "hero" isn't a perfect person who always gets things right. - *Principles (pg. 108-111)*

It's wrong to assume either that a person in one role will be successful in another role or that the ways one person operates will work well for another.

---------------------------------

## PART 2 - Life Principles.

### 1.Embrace Reality and Deal with it.

**1.1 Be a hyperrealist** 

People who create great things aren't idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality.
Dreams + Reailty + Determination = a successfull life

**1.2 An accurate understanding of reality is the essential foundation for any good outcome.**

**1.3 Be radically open-minded and radically transparent.**

The more open-minded you are, the less likely you are to deceive yourself-and the more likely it is that others will give you honest feed back.

Don't let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.

**1.4 Look to nature to learn how reality works.**

Most people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they empathize with, ignoring the greater good.

Perfection doesn't exist. If nature, or anything, were perfect it wouldn't be evolving. So rather than **getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we're perfect**, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them. **You will either learn valuable lessons from your mistakes and press on**, better equipped to succeed-or you won't and you will fail.

**1.6 Understand nature's practical lessons.**

**No pain, no gain**. While we don't like pain, everything that nature made has a purpose, so nature gave us pain for a purpose. So what is its purpose? It alerts us and helps direct us.

**1.7 Pain + Reflection = Progress.**

Go to the pain rather than avoid it.

The quality of your life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments. 

**No matter what you want out of life, your ability to adapt and move quickly and efficiently through the process of personal evolution will determine your success and your happiness.**

**1.9 Own your outcomes.**

Life gives you so many decisions to make and so many opportunities to recover from your mistakes. There are many paths to happiness.

Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyong your control.

**1.10 Look at the machine from the higher level.**  pg.157

The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively.

If you discover that you as the worker can't do something well, you need to fire yourself as the worker and get a good replacement.

**You shoudn't be upset if you find out that you're bad at something-you should be happy that you found out.**

### 2.Use the 5-Step Process

If your emotions are getting the better of you, step back and take time out until you can reflect clearly. If necessary, seek guidance from calm, thoughtful people.

**Mistakes are inevitable**

### 3. Be radically Open-Minded

**3.1 Regconize your two barriers.**

If you are too proud of what you know or of how good you are at something **you will learn less, make inferior decisions, and fall short of your potential.**

**3.2 Practice radical open-mindedness.**

It requires you to **replace your attachment to always being right with the joy of learning what's true.**

Remember that you're looking for the best answer, not simply the best anser that you can come up with yourself.

Open-mindedness doesn't mean going along with what you don't believe in; it means considering the reasoning of others instead of stubbornly and illogically holding on to your own point of view. To be radically open-minded, you need to be so open to the possibility that you could be wrong that you encourage others to tell you so.

Thoughtfull disagreement: Your goal is not to convince the other party that you are right-it is to find out which view is true and decide what to do about it.

You are not arguing; you are openly exploring what's true.

**It doesn't pay to be open-minded with everyone. Instead, spend your time exploring ideas with the most believable people you have access to.**.

### 5. Learn how to make decisions effectively

The biggest threat to good decision making is harmful emotions.

------------------------------------
## PART 3 - Work Principles.

### 3. It is okay to make mistakes.

Pain is a message that something is wrong and it's an effective teacher that one shouldn't do that wrong thing again. 

If you don't mind being wrong on the way to being right you'll learn a lot - and increase your effectiveness.

Don't feel bad about your mistakes or those of others. Love them.

### 4. Get and Stay in Sync.

Conflicts are essential for great relationships.

Being open-minded is much more important than being bright or smart.

### 5. Believability weight your decision making.

If you can't successfully do something, don't think you can tell others how it should be done.

### 8. Hire Right, because the Penalties for hiring wrong are huge.

Performance in school doesn't tell you much about whether a person has the values and abilities you are looking for. When it comes to assessing a candidate's common sense, vision, creativity, or decision-making abilities, school records are of limited value.

**In great partnerships, consideration and generosity are more important than money**. The only purpose of money is to get you what you want, so think hard about what you value and put it above money.
